To compile this game,
the files that need to be compiled are
game.cpp object.cpp shader.cpp player.cpp coin.cpp laser.cpp coinbox.cpp laserbox.cpp textobject.cpp 

We need to link the glad, freetype and the glfw3 libraries in order to compile this.

run gcc game.cpp ... textobject.cpp -lglad -lfreetype -lglfw3
These libraries must be installed and must be there where g++ can locate them.

If you are on a Mac, then we need to use frameworks and add commands 
-framework IOKit -framework OpenGL -framework -Cocoa
along with the above command for compiling the game
